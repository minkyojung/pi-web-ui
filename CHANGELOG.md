# Changelog

All notable changes to Octave are written down here, for the person using it
rather than the person building it. The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/2.0.0/);
the versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/), and while they begin with 0 anything may change.

## [Unreleased]

The first release. Octave is a notes app for the Mac with an agent that works in the same notes you do.

### Added
- Your notes are markdown files in a folder you choose. There is no account, no server and no database: Octave is a window onto the folder, and anything else that edits those files is welcome to.
- An agent sits beside the note and reads and writes the same files. Ask it about the note you are in, about words you have selected, or about the whole folder; type `@` to point it at a note and `/` for its commands.
- What the agent writes in a note stays a suggestion until you decide: each change is shown against what it replaced, with Keep and Undo, for as long as you leave it — days, if you like. Everything one run changed can be put back in one go.
- Every word keeps its author. A switch shows which words are yours, which the agent wrote, and which arrived from outside Octave; click the agent's words to see which model wrote them and what it was asked. Cut and paste keeps the author with the words.
- The agent starts careful. A new conversation can read and edit notes but cannot run shell commands or reach the web; Full access and Web access are one step away in the tool menu, and stay where you put them.
- Sign in inside the app, in Settings → Accounts: a subscription account or an API key, for the provider you choose. Your notes go to that provider when you ask the agent something, and nowhere else.
- Links between notes, tags, and properties at the top of a note, in the shapes Obsidian uses — a folder of notes made there opens here as it is. Two things such a folder will miss for now: images inside notes are not shown, and neither is the list of notes that link to the one you are in.
- Tabs, back and forward, find in a note, find across the folder, open a note by a few letters of its name, and a bin that deleted notes come back from.
- Conversations are kept, named, and can be forked from any question, cloned, or exported.
- Light and dark themes.
- A signed, notarized disk image for Apple Silicon Macs. Octave updates itself: a new version is downloaded in the background and offered, with its notes, when it is ready.
- Octave is free software under the AGPL-3.0; the licences of everything it is built on ship inside it.
